# kimtools

## Installation 

```r
devtools::install_github("jaeyk/kimtools")
```

## Description 

- I developed this package solely because I am lazy and I found that creating a personal R package is an efficient way to collect, reuse, and refine my code snippets and distribute them.

- The package is written by following Hadley Wickam and Jennifer Bryan's amazing book on [R package development](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). I also found [this package development cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.pdf) by RStudio and Karl Broman's [R package primer](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/) extremely helpful.
