# kimtools

- The package is written by following Hadley Wickam and Jennifer Bryan's [R package development book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). (There's an old and a new version of the book; Use the new version.) I found [this package development cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.pdf) by RStudio extremeley helpful.

- I developed this pacakge solely because I am lazy and I found that creating a personal R package is an efficient way to collect, reuse, and refine my code snippets and distribute them.
