# kimtools

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("jaeyk/kimtools")
```

## Description

- I developed this package because I am lazy. I found that creating a personal R package is an efficient way to collect, reuse, and refine my code snippets and distribute them.

- The package is written by following Hadley Wickam and Jennifer Bryan's book on [R package development](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). I also found Karl Broman's [R package primer](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/) helpful.
