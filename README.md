# kimtools

- The package is written by following Hadley Wickam's [R package development book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). I found [this package development cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.pdf) by RStudio extremeley helpful.

- I developed this pacakge solely because I am lazy and I want to find more systematically to reuse and refine my old code and distribute them more easilly.
